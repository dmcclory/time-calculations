        <p>If you want to make a process more efficient, you can only work on it for so long before you end spending more time than you save.<p>
        <p>This helps you find the cutoff point and - yup! - is based on this classic <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD comic.</a>

    <p>How to read this table:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The columns: how many times a day/week/month do you need to do the task?</li>
      <li>The rows: if you can shave off X amount of time per task...</li>
      <li>The cells: ... then you can spend up to this much time making improvements before you're spending more than you save.</li>
